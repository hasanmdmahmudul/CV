BARC Logo

BAUET Automation and Robotics Club (BARC) is an initiative taken by the students and faculties of BAUET. The main objective of founding this club is to develop professional engineering skills among the students which will help them in the professional life through teamwork activities. The motivation of founding this club is to enhance cooperation among the students of different departments as well as among students of different batches. The club will frequently arrange workshops and seminars about different technological scheme like robotics, Microcontroller, Arduino, MATLAB, SIMULINK etc. 

The students will share their views and ideas with their teachers and they can participate and compete in different competitions like Robo race, Robo Fight Contests, Tech Fiesta, Tech Carnival & Project Shows. They will represent BAUET among others as representatives which will enlighten our university among many of the universities. 

BAUET Automation and Robotics Club(BARC) successfully arranged an intra-university project fair and another inter-university Tech fair in 2017 and 2018 accordingly. The future plan of BAUET Automation and Robotics Club is to arrange Robo race & Robo Fight Contests, Tech Fiesta, Tech Carnival & Project Showcasing events as intra-university tech festival and inter-university tech festival event. Students from any of the departments of BAUET are always welcomed in BARC and can become a member of BARC. But the Students must have the interest and enthusiasm for robotics. Many BAUETians, young scientists teams, who are working with BAUET Automation and Robotics Club (BARC) are working hard, making some interesting projects and they are making us proud.

3. MEMBER, EXECUTION COMMITTEE,

 INNOVATION HUB, BAUET

A2I

A tech-based startup wanted to design a technology that allowed students to access multimedia content in communities still off the electricity grid. A local non-profit social development organization, working with disability rights, wanted to convert national curriculum textbooks available in Bangla into accessible education content for visually impaired children and slow learners. A government entity wanted to automate the system for applying for and receiving an environment clearance certificate. And a local innovator with his team wanted to develop their own version of 3D printers that could manufacture artificial limbs and any small scale prototype at much less time and cost than their foreign counterparts.

These innovative ideas faced a few common obstacles –

1. The innovators did not have the funds to develop complete prototypes

2. They could not test the efficacy of the prototypes with real users or beneficiaries.

CREATIVE WORKS
1.  Research Project- Solar Tracking Solar Panel (Got Joy Bangla Youth Award):

-  In this project, a methodology of an automatic solar tracker was designed by means of both sensors and image processing simultaneously. The mechanism of solar tracking was implemented by the use of image processing and LDR sensors.

-  Got ‘Joy Bangla Youth Award-2015’ (May 2, 2015) in Scientific and technological development by Centre of Research and Information (CRI) of Bangladesh as one of the 200 achievers from Bangladesh. The Young Bangla project is targeted in response to youth engagement and empowerment. Through intensive field work and research, it aims at gathering the information and enlist the youth organization from all corner of Bangladesh whoever is working for the betterment of the country. The project consists of different kind of components and events. Joy Bangla Youth Award is one of them that are to recognize the positive social welfare movement of the youth of the Bangladesh. Joy Bangla Youth Award-2015 was given in 10 categories to the 200 young achievers in their sectors among them the top ten was nominated to Ten Outstanding Persons of the world from Bangladesh organized by JCI worldwide.

RESEARCH PROJECTS [Completed]

1. Development of an EEG-based Biometric Identification and Authentication System



Biometrics is the process of identifying an individual from other individual by biological means. Conventional biometrics includes fingerprint, facial detection or iris detection but they have some limitations. To eliminate the drawbacks of conventional biometrics and enhance reliability we need to search for a new biometrics named EEG biometrics. EEG biometrics uses brainwave signals to identify an individual from others. By using the small intra-individual and large inter-individual difference in EEG, individuals can be identified with more accuracy. In this research, a methodology of identifying an individual is proposed by determining the most effective domain and feature of EEG signal. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used for the classification approach. All the designed classifier was able to identify all 3 subjects correctly with very small mean square error.

Research Output: 3 IEEE Conference papers

2. An Accurate and Efficient Solar Tracking System using Image Processing and LDR Sensor         


In this project, a methodology of an automatic solar tracker was designed by means of both sensors and image processing simultaneously. The mechanism of solar tracking was implemented by the use of an image processing software which combines the effect of sensors and processed image of sun and controls the solar panel accordingly. The methodology was a combination of hardware and software which could be used to control hundreds of solar panels in a solar power plant with more accuracy. The proposed project is more accurate and efficient than the conventional solar tracking systems which can optimize the power requirement.

Research Output: 1 IEEE Conference paper
